For db_dump_version_2.sql: After taking feedback from my friends DEBANJAN GHOSH and Arhit Chatterjee, I have modified a few sections and added 2 more dashboards :

1. Profit Analysis
2. Performance Insight

In Profit Analysis, we are calculating Profit = Sales - Cost. Then, we are calculating Profit Margin % = Profit/Cost. In this way, we are getting Revenue, Revenue Margin Contribution, Profit, Profit Margin Contribution, and all of the above attributes are in both tabular and graphical format for clear understanding also having the number written for each and every zone.

In Performance Insight, we are calculating and visualizing the Zones taking parameters like year, month, previous Revenue, Current Year Revenue, Profit Margin, and so on. Most of the Marketing companies have their goal. So, we set here%. We can vary it according to our wish by just increasing/decreasing the Profit Target Bar at the top of the
3rd DashBoard. And then we can make decisions about where Sales is less or more, where the company should improve, where they should set new branches/outlets for serving customers etc.

Like the previous dashboard which I uploaded, we can see a particular year also for a month's performance too.

If you find it helpful, kindly make cheer up and comment on this post.

For this Visualization, you need only MySQL and PowerBI. Tableau one will be uploaded soon.
